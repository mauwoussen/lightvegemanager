'''
    LightVegeManager_tesselator
    ****************************

    Handles tesselation of a triangulation, the subdivision of triangulation.
    The tesselation was initially made to have a better matching of a triangle mesh in a grid of voxels
    and avoid triangle to be located in several voxels

    Tesselation operates as a recursive function until a certain level is reached
